====Goals===

Make it more of a central panel and helper during a flight eg on a twin screen or spare laptop

 * The mpmap embedded to watch other and navaids
 * Being able to browse aircraft and save configurations
 * Being able to select airport/runway and save configurations
 * Ability to select enviroment and save configurations
 * Combine all the above to save a profile

 * Potentially have a flightplan os  a list of fun locations, eg Madeira or Courchevel

If it gets real then convert application to c++/Qt so it easy for x-platform ie windoze
